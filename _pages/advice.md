Having grown up at UCSD, many upperclassmen have shaped my journey. Now, I want to give back by sharing my experiences and guidance. I used to spend countless hours searching past course websites, syllabi, cheatsheets, and other resources at UCSD. To streamline this, I've centralized all my UCSD resources here for anyone seeking similar information. I hope you find my [advice](#advice) and [resources](#resources) useful.

## Advice

Now includes [course recommendation](#course-recommendation), [schedule planning](#schedule-planning), and [more](#becoming-an-ia).

### Course Recommendation

1. CSE 151B/251B with Prof. [Gary Cottrell](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gary/).
   - One of the toughest classes at UCSD if you have no experience is AI/ML. However, you will be able to gain a lot from it if you devote your time.

2. CSE 250A with Prof. [Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tberg/).
   - A solid substitute for DSC 140A if you are a data science major student. Prof. Berg-Kirkpatrick's lectures are some of the best I have seen at UCSD.

3. COGS 118A with Prof. [Zhuowen Tu](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~ztu/) or [Jason Fleischer](https://jgfleischer.com/).
   - I did not take their offering of COGS 118A, but the course designed by either of them is good for an introduction to machine learning.

4. MATH 173A/B with Prof. [Rayan Saab](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~rsaab/).
   - I did not take Prof. Saab's offering of the MATH 173 sequence. However, he designed this great sequence, and he is really good at explaining mathematical concepts based on my experience of working with him on a project.

### Schedule Planning

If you are interested in taking classes together, please find my quarter-by-quarter plan below. Please note that this plan is tentative and subject to change. If you would like to discuss potential classes, group projects, or simply connect with me, please do not hesitate to reach out via email, Zoom, or by arranging a meeting at the Geisel Library.

I have been assisting fellow students with schedule planning since my freshman year, and I am happy to help with any questions you may have regarding scheduling if you are in a similar major or from the same college (Warren).

### Becoming an IA

Since my freshman year, I have been serving as an Instructional Assistant at UCSD, and have provided numerous suggestions and tips to fellow students regarding the application process for various positions in different departments. If you are interested in becoming a Math TA, CSE Tutor, DSC Tutor, or Econ UIA, I would be more than happy to offer guidance and advice. Please do not hesitate to contact me.

## Resources

Now includes [links](#links), [cheatsheets](#cheatsheets), and [course websites/syllabi](#course-websitessyllabi).

### Links

**WebReg Scripts**  
This is a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ewang2002/webweg) that allows you to do lots of things on WebReg. It can help you monitor available seats for specific classes, enroll instantly when it is your appointment time, and more.


**IA System**  
This is the [IA System](https://academicaffairs.ucsd.edu/Modules/ASES/Default.aspx), where you can find open positions for academic student employee (TA/Tutor) jobs, your past evaluations, and information on your past assignments. This link has never been connected to any of the UCSD pages I have visited.


### Cheatsheets

I am not particularly good at creating cheatsheets as I tend to be lazy. However, I have friends who are experts in this area.


**DSC 80**

This **[cheatsheet](../assets/pdfs/cheatsheet/dsc80_cs.pdf)** was developed by [Xiaoyue](https://dpwxy.github.io/xiaoyuewang15.github.io/). It contains **everything** from the DSC 80 lectures that you need to know to get an A+. If you have a solid background, you could theoretically study the entire course in one day.

**DSC 102**

This **[cheatsheet](../assets/pdfs/cheatsheet/dsc102_cs.pdf)** was developed by [Xiaoyue](https://dpwxy.github.io/xiaoyuewang15.github.io/) and [Yi](https://jerryli1019.github.io/jerryliyi.github.io/). This has been proven to potentially help you score the second highest in the class without needing to study at all!
