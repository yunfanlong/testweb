      <p>We introduce BLIVA, an augmented version of InstructBLIP with Visual Assistant. BLIVA incorporates the query embeddings from InstructBLIP and also directly projects encoded patch embeddings into the LLM, a technique inspired by LLaVA. This approach ensures that the model captures intricate details potentially missed during the query decoding process. Empirical evidence demonstrates that our model, BLIVA, significantly enhances performance in processing text-rich VQA benchmarks (up to 17.76% in OCR-VQA benchmark) and in undertaking typical VQA benchmarks (up to 7.9% in Visual Spatial Reasoning benchmark), comparing to our baseline InstructBLIP. BLIVA demonstrates significant capability in decoding real-world images, irrespective of text presence.</p>

      <p>Our project proposes two architectures with early or late concatenations to improve the performance of the original cGANs paper's architecture. The project involves training cDCGANs and cGANs on large-scale labeled datasets, where the models are conditioned on auxiliary information such as class labels. We also employ various metrics to evaluate the performance, and the results show that our cDCGANs model validates its effectiveness in generating high-quality and realistic images.</p>

      <p>In this project, we trained an algorithm to caption input images. This required the algorithm to identify objects in the images and match them to a corpus of text. We used PyTorch to implement multiple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models, including LSTM, Vanilla RNN, and a custom model (Architecture 2), to generate captions for the images in our dataset, specifically the well-known COCO Image Captioning Task.</p>

      <p>We implemented Logistic Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent to classify Japanese Hiragana hand writings from the KMNIST dataset. We then used Singular Value Decomposition to reduce the size of images for the goals of decreasing memory allocations and hopefully increasing the performance of the model. After applying Singular Value Decomposition, we were able to achieve 99% of testing accuracy on classifying お and ま with 40% less memory allocation on the original images as well as around 87% of testing accuracy on classifying す and ま with 40% less memory allocation on the original images.</p>

      <p>In this project, we make use of the vaccination/death data by country, and explore the relationship between the set of {nation-wide onset date of vaccination, average new vaccination/death rate across different time spans}, and various metrics of happiness score in 2021. In particular, we are trying to figure out to what extent our independent varibles, namely all COVID-19 related data, are correlated to these metrics (i.e. social support, healthy life expectancy, perception of corruption, and generosity) of happiness scores.</p>

### Others

This is a [website](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/weiyue-li-first-year-japanese/home) that contains works I have done for the 3-quarter sequence of first-year Japanese courses I have taken in my freshman year of college. In case you are interested in taking the sequence, here are the topics you will work on.

This [page](/teaching_portfolio/) captures all of my work from EDS 124BR (Teach Computational Thinking). I think this course has helped me to become better at my job as a teaching assistant.

#### Taming COVID-19 Statistics to Reflect Happiness Score Metrics

* For the goal of promoting Covid-19 vaccinations to antivaccinists, researched how the onset of vaccination, the vaccination rates, and the death rate in a country are related to the happiness score of that country.
* Collected datasets on Covid-19 vaccination records, happiness scores by country, and population reports. Designed metrics and performed data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis to find meaningful patterns. Built statistical models and machine learning pipelines to further analyze the problem.
* Detected trends that countries have earlier access to Covid-19 vaccines and were vaccinating faster have higher happiness scores.


#### Party Affiliation of Congressmen by their Stock Trades
* Cleaned the dataset and imputed missing values with different statistical techniques. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis, Hypothesis tests, and Permutation tests to detect Congressmen's stock preferences on companies and industries from both parties.
* Extracted useful features from the dataset and built binary classification models to predict the party affiliation of Congressmen based on the information of their stock trades. Achieved 87.32% accuracy in determining the party affiliation after fine-tuning.


#### Crime Index and Wealth Analysis

* Collected and cleaned data of neighborhoods around San Diego from ArcGIS, and performed exploratory data analysis on average wealth in the communities and their corresponding crime indexes.
* Built data visualization and performed A\|B testings to better explain our variables, built machine learning pipelines for predictive analysis, and applied geospatial analysis to support our findings that areas with higher average household income are generally more robust to crimes. -->
